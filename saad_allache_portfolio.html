            <p>
                I’m Saad Allache. A creative at heart, I express myself through graphic design, photography, 
                video editing, and even on stage as an actor. What drives me is bringing ideas to life, capturing moments, 
                and creating visuals that speak as much as they inspire. Each project is a new adventure for me, filled 
                with creativity and passion.

            <h2>VISION</h2>
            <p>
                My vision as a creative is rooted in the constant exploration of emotions and stories through imagery. 
                Whether it's through graphic design, photography, or video editing, I strive to capture the essence of each project 
                and translate it into a unique visual work. My experience as an actor enriches this approach, allowing me to better 
                understand the narrative and aesthetic nuances. My goal is to create works that resonate, inspire, and communicate 
                with strength and authenticity.

            <h2>CHOICE</h2>
            <p>
                In a world where every decision can alter the course of a life, *"Choice"* takes the viewer into the universe of Akram, a teenager tormented by family issues. Surrounded by bad influences, Akram finds himself at a crossroads, torn between the temptation to fall into crime and the hope for a better life. The film explores the consequences of bad company and impulsive decisions. Through a series of poignant scenes, the audience follows Akram as he seems to drift toward an uncertain future.

                    "Choice" speaks to young people, illustrating in a realistic way the challenges they may face and the solutions they can find within themselves. With heartfelt performances and visually rich direction, the short film captures the essence of the human dilemma: the choice between what is easy and what is right. This film is not just a passion project but also a message of hope. It shows that even in the darkest moments, there is always a path to light.

                    However, in an unexpected twist, what appeared to be a downward spiral is, in reality, just a projection of his mind—a vision of what his life could become if he doesn't make the right choice. Faced with this realization, Akram takes a symbolic action by refusing to smoke his first cigarette, choosing instead to turn away from bad influences and dedicate himself to sports, a healthy outlet to escape his family problems.
